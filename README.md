# AOT Library Components
The purpose of this project is to create custom components which are build into libraries and can be integrated into any Angular 2 app without any custom settings.

The project is still in its initial stages any contributions in the build system are appreciated.

# Build System
The build system is still in progress but the steps done so far are as follows:
1. convert component styles and templates to inline
2. compile the component using AoT compiler
3. clean the compiled version
4. copy package.json to make the component shipable
